      <div>I am a full stack web developer who has taken an extreme interest in Ethereum and blockchain in general. I have been following the scene and have owned some cryptocurrency since 2012 but have only recently gotten involved technically. I have been spending the last year and a half building and extensively testing smart contracts both professionally and in my free time. It has become a very serious passion of mine.</div>
