Greetings young fellow developer,

here is your:     
## 3rd task    

Goal: Add button to your first screen 'Action'  

Steps:
1. Run the project
2. Go to file
3. Create new button 'Record'

Helpful ressources:

- Buttons: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/button

### 1. Run the project

- Open your terminal (cmd)
- cd to your talk_to_me folder
- enter in the terminal:
```
expo start
```
Result: You will have the project started and runnable with expo on your mobile   

### 2. Go to file
Open the project with your favorite IDE (*Mine is ATOM*)
Open the file 'HomeScreen.js' in the IDE.

Result: At the end you will have the file ready to get changed


### 3. Set new titles for bottom navigation
See the existing content.    
We will remove this and create a new button.    
```

```  

Result: The app should display the new button on the action page when reloaded the app.
